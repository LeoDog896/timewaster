I give up, just wasting my time

In more detail, this project had two goals.
- Learn some react
- Give up

After going through all 5 stages of grief I have realized that this is the only fun thing I can do on the chromebook after finishing work. A task so repetetive it can be completely automated by a simple react website. Have fun, I guess.

## Using it
pnpm build vite something something
